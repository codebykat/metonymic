metonymic
==================

JavaScript app that lists WordPress posts as a dictionary. Uses the <a href="developers.wordpress.com/docs/api">WordPress.com REST API</a>.

Check out <a href="https://github.com/codebykat/metonymic/releases/tag/Flask">the previous version</a> for a Flask app that supported both WordPress and Tumblr blogs. I got sick of hosting it on Heroku so I gutted it :)
